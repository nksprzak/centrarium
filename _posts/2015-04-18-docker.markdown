Today in class my professor mentioned a program that allows you to build and run operating systems fast. Faster than normal virtual machine software because of Docker uses a cache of the machine. 

Docker is not a virtual machine thoough, it is a container. [Here](https://serversforhackers.com/getting-started-with-docker/) is a good introduction to Docker with some basic code examples. 

Another good article I found [here](http://blog.shrikrishnaholla.in/post/2014/01/12/docker-the-good-parts/). One about [speed](http://blog.scoutapp.com/articles/2013/08/28/docker-git-for-deployment)

What should someone say in there first blog post? I think it depends on what is on your mind and what you want to say. 

There are so many topics, issues, challenges to talk about and thus to nuture an audience you should write as broadly as possible. But the old adage is "Write what you know", not "Write what you can find from Google". So I think I will play to my strengths and talk about things that interest me and what I do day to day. 

Today I spent the day researching and building various Jekyll sites with Github Pages. It was very rewarding to create something so fast and I never realized how simple it now is to make a site that looks nice.

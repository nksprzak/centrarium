Why does Japan always look amazing in pictures? Even if it is some weird hellish landscape post-Fukishima, the Japanese seem to have everything together. Maybe it is there shrewd business practices or crazy porn. Whatever it is I know that Japan is a special flower of a country and I have always wanted to travel there. 

If only for a couple weeks, I can imagine taking a bullet train into Tokyo and various areas of Japan. Meeting locales, seeing the sites and eating all the sushi that I want. At night you could hit up the clubs and impress all the ladies as a blonde foreigner. All is just dreams though. 

To travel is to live because every experience is a new one. Fresh memories to remisnice in your later years as fond. Who you spend this with is everything in life. To find someone special is a tiring task, but maybe if I try hard enough I could see clearly enough to grab someone. 

There seems to be a disconnect between America and Americans but never with Japan. The people are the land. Quiet, reserved, beautiful. Beatuy is only beatiful because it is fleeting.

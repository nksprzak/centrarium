The importance of programming can not be underestimated. However you shouldn't just be an amateur programmer, you must be an excelllent one. I am going to list what I think will help me become a better programmer. 

## Rules

1. Write code at least once a day
2. Update my blog/resume every day.
3. Update resume and apply 
4. Practice Java and C++
5. Review major concepts
6. Prepare for post-graduate life

More to come. Hopefully the quality will start to increase.

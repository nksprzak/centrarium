I have found the best music in the past few days. A relatively new artist named Courtney Barnett. Everything she has put out is straight fire from an indie rock standpoint. She also is Austrlian, cute, and plays left-handed guitar. I don't know if this person is real or not but she has a bunch of Youtube view so I suppose she is legitament. 

Back to the grind.
